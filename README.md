*As of 1/27/23*

- Added ability to remove items
- Added filter for paid/unpaid expenses

## Description  
View and manage all of your expenses the easy way with Budget Breakdown! This app will better help you keep track of your credit card balance while also making it easier to begin paying it off.<br>
This app lets you enter your expenses specifying the date of the transaction, the amount you charged, the merchant with whom the transaction took place, and whether or not you paid off the expense yet. Your total credit balance is shown at the top. There is also a dropdown menu that lets you filter between paid and unpaid expenses.
<br>  

### Motivation
I don't know about you, but I use my credit card for most things I pay for nowadays. But the more expenses I've began picking up, the more I've found myself needing to know EXACTLY what my current balance is. I grew tired of constantly checking my online statement, seeing charges, but not exactly knowing whether or not I actually PAID for the (you know, with money).  

#### *But not only that!*  
  
I would also find myself paying multiple bills the same day and, as you know, a lot of banking apps don't update your balance until a day or two later -- which is why I needed a way to see what my balance would be after paying a bill just in case I needed to pay another one right afterwards!  

### Plans for the Future
This app may be simple, but there are a lot of features I plan to implement such as:
- A way to edit expenses
- Implementing a page system with a maximum of about 10 or 20 expenses per page
- Support for multiple accounts and account types (i.e. checking, savings, credit, etc.)
- More filter options

## How to Install and Run the Application

Download the zip from here and uncompress into your workspace directory (or any directory where you'll remember). Then go into your IDE or Text Editor (I used VS Code) and open a terminal. **Also make sure you have Node.js installed!** Once you're in the terminal, navigate to the project directory on your local drive and run: 
<br>

`npm install` to install all dependencies
<br>

and then run:

`npm start`
<br>

to start the development server. This will open localhost:3000 in your web browser and *voila!* You're up and running!
