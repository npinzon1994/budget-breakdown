## Description  
Budget Breakdown is a money management application that helps you organize and stay on top of your finances. Supports Google, Apple, and email authentication so you can use the app across all your devices. Once you sign up, you can make records of all your financial accounts, their balances, due dates, and associated transactions. I ultimately want to add reminders, reports, and graphs -- like for displaying how much you spend vs. save -- or reminders letting you know to ease up on the spending because your account is running low.
<br>

### Motivation
I've was inspired to create Budget Breakdown when I was living on my own for the first time far away from my hometown, and had to get used to the struggle of paying rent. I was already using a budgeting app I downloaded from the app store but there were a lot of things I didn't like about it -- like transferring money between accounts wasn't intuitive. I also started learning React around that time so I figured this would be the perfect app for me to start with.

### Planned Features
- Home section (in the dashboard) where User can see their accounts, bills, reminders, and reports
- Support for Users being able to add recurring bills
- Money in vs. money out for a given time frame -- GRAPH
- Ability to search for expenses by Merchant, Amount, or Date

## How to Install and Run the Application

Download the zip from here and uncompress it into your workspace directory (or any directory where you'll remember). Then go into your IDE or Text Editor (I used VS Code) and open a terminal. **make sure you have Node.js installed** Once you're in the terminal, navigate to the project directory on your local drive and run: 
<br>

`npm install` to install all dependencies
<br>

and then run:

`npm run dev`
<br>

to start the development server. Then open localhost:3000 in your web browser and you're good to go ðŸ‘Œ
